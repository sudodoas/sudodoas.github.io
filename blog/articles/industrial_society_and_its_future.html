	    	<h1>Industrial society and it's future</h1>
	    	<h2>Why Theodore Kaczynski was right</h2>
	    	<p>
	    	In 1995, there was a man living in a cabin in the middle of the woods in Montana. His name was Theodore Kaczynski. Is this something special?
            No. Not particularly. But there was something special about this man. You see, he was smart. He had gone to Harvard and had taught
            as a university professor for some time. He was an excellent mathematician. Why would such a successful man go and live in the woods?
            Because he realised the truth about Industrial Society. Long stories short - he killed some proponents of Industrial Society, and, at the
            time of this writing, is sitting in a jail cell.

            Most people, when they read the article, are shocked by how true it is. They feel enlightened. This was not the case for me. When I read it
            I felt as if it was confirming thoughts that I had already thought. The only shock that I got was because of how accurately his thoughts 
            aligned with mine. I thought I was the only one who though about aspects of Industrial Society such as the loud noises. I didn't expect
            anyone, let alone someone in 1995, to write about how loud the machines of Industrial Society were.

            Another thing is the so-called "prophesies" which he writes. Here is an excerpt from his article:
            <quote>
                158. It presumably would be impractical for all people
                to have electrodes inserted in their heads so that they
                could be controlled by the authorities. But the fact that
                human thoughts and feelings are so open to biological
                intervention shows that the problem of controlling human 
                behavior is mainly a technical problem; a problem
                of neurons, hormones and complex molecules; the kind
                of problem that is accessible to scientific attack. Given the
                outstanding record of our society in solving technical problems,
                it is overwhelmingly probable that great advances
                will be made in the control of human behavior.

            When I read this I instantly thought of Elon Musk's Neuralink project. Keep in mind that this was written around 1995. He had seen the
            trends in technology and noticed that this kind of technology could be possible in the future. You can also note from his writing style
            how smart he is.
