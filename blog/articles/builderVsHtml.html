      <h1>Which is better: A website builder or HTML?</h1>
      <h2>HTML of course</h2>
      <p>
        There are two main options to choose from when choosing how to build your website:<br>
        <trees>HTML</trees> or <trees>website builder</trees>. The option you choose will affect the amount of time you site <br>
        takes to make and the amount of customizability that you have over your site.<br>
        <br>
        When building a website with HTML, one has to manually type out all of the elements that they will use in their site.<br>
        This takes a lot of <trees>time</trees> which will be a hindrance if the site has a specific deadline. Website builders enable you to <br>
        launch a working website in a couple of hours or even less than an hour.<br>
        <br>
        Website builders allow you to drag and drop elements onto a template which will become your webpage. There are only a limited amount of<br>
        features that you can use. If you want to use more features, you have to pay for them. Even with additional features, website builders<br>
        don't allow you to do everything. With HTML, you have the <trees>freedom</trees> to use any of the avalible features in HTML and you are not limimted <br>
        to the placement and styling of your elements.<br>
        <br>
        Another factor to take into account when choosing your method of building your website is the amount of <trees>learning</trees> that you will have <br>
        to do. Website builders like Wix and Google Sites are very intuitive. HTML is a language that has to be learned. You have to follow <br>
        a specific syntax when using it.<br>
        <br>
        At the end of the day, you are free to choose which method you will use to make your website. Use this page as a guideline to help you <br>
        choose. My opinion is that everyone should learn HTML as it is a useful skill to learn.
