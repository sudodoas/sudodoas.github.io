	      <h1>The final solution to social media</h1>
	      <h2>Is there even a solution?</h2>
	      <p>
          To say that we need a solution to <trees>social media</trees> implies that there is currently a problem with it.
          Most people view social media as sources of entertainment and they struggle to find any <trees>problems</trees>.
	      I will show you that there are a few problems that you may only realise if you cease to use
	      these applications for a while.
	      <br>
	      <br>
          The first one is that it is <trees>addictive</trees>. Just install a screen-time application and you will
	      be shocked at how long you spend on these sites/apps. A very long time for something that
          brings you <trees>minimal benefit</trees>. What causes you to waste hours and hours of your time on something that
	      does not improve your life at all? 
	      <br>
	      <br>
          It is <trees>addictive</trees>. 
	      <br>
	      <br>
	      Software engineers implement years of human psychology research into their programs to keep users
          <trees>hooked</trees> on them as long as possible. It is a disgusting form of human <trees>exploitation</trees>. There are theories 
          about how the government wants to keep the population <trees>weak</trees>, and that is the reason behind all these harmful 
          technologies. Although I may subscribe to some theories of this nature, I don't believe them without a <trees>doubt</trees>; 
          I don't believe most things without a doubt. And there is some sensibility behind this way of thinking.
          <br>
          <br>
          You see, whether or not the <trees>government</trees> does these things, there is little benefit to ponder over this (in my opinion).
          What we should rather do is to see what <trees>effect</trees> these technologies have on us. In order to test this, we need a so called
          <trees>"control"</trees>. What I mean by this is that we should abstain from technologies for a period of time and see how this compares
          to the periods when we use technology.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have gone on many <trees>dopamine detoxes</trees> where I completely abstain for technology. This is something which I have found
          beneficial for <trees>productivity</trees>, and my concentration and focus is greatly increased during those periods. I shall not go
          into too much detail since I want you to experience it for yourself. Go for at least two weeks without any technology whatsoever and
          note the difference in your daily routine.
          <br>
          <br>
          At the time of writing this I am still unaware as to whether <trees>Deep Work</trees> is possible in the presence of
          digital technology. There were short periods of time where I was able to <trees>control</trees> myself well in terms of the amount of time
          I spent on tech each day. But, at the end of the day, it is still a war between us and the <trees>evil technologists</trees> who want to
          keep us busy while their wallets get filled.
          <br>
          <br>
          In our <trees>modern world</trees>, it is very difficult and sometimes almost impossible to live without technology. That is the reason
          I still use it: because I am <trees>forced</trees> to. One day, when my children ask me what I did during my teenage years, will I be
          able to tell them stories of adventures? Or can I only <trees>pathetically</trees> tell them that I wasted my youth in front of a screen.
          It is not something nice to think about, but this is the <trees>reality</trees> of our modern lives (most of us).
          <br>
          <br>
          I could go into detail about the harmful effects of these technologies our our bodies' <trees>domaminergic</trees> system, but, in all honesty,
          I don't know enough about it to convey to you. What I know is that the constant dopamine <trees>spikes</trees> provided by these
          media desensitises your dopaminergic system and it becomes <trees>downregulated</trees>. (I know a few more things, but do your own
          research if you want to learn about it.)
          <br>
          <br>
          In <trees>conclusion</trees>, this is a very vast topic to discuss, and there is probably so much more to say regarding it. I hope that one day I will
          be able to quit technology and live a simple, normal life, but, at the current moment, I am unable to. So I will just use this evil tech
          until I can leave it. I hope this may help you question your current notions you have about technology, and see the <trees>truth</trees> for what it is.
