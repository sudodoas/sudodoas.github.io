		<h1>The final solution to social media</h1>
		<h2>Is there even a solution?</h2>
	  </center>
		<p>
		To say that we need a solution to social media implies that there is currently a problem with it.
		Most people view social media as sources of entertainment and they struggle to find any problems.
		I will show you that there are a few problems that you may only realise if you cease to use
		these applications for a while.
		<br>
		<br>
		The first one is that it is addictive. Just install a screen-time application and you will
		be shocked at how long you spend on these sites/apps. A very long time for something that
		brings you minimal benefit. What causes you to waste hours and hours of your time on something that
		does not improve your life at all? 
		<br>
		<br>
		It is addictive. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Software engineers implement years of human psychology research into their programs to keep users
		hooked on them as long as possible. It is a disgusting form of human exploitation.
