	    	<h2>Why you should avoid it at all times</h2>
	    	<p>
	    	Do I hold an extreme view? Maybe so. You might think so. Society may think so. I don't think so. I think it is very sensible, actually.
            Give me a chance to explain the various reasons why music is not something which you should listen to.
            <br>
            <br>
            Firstly, let us look at some reasons people may consume music. Some might give the reason that it is entertaining. This is such a vague word.
            What does entertainment even mean? We know that it is not a human necessity. If we don't need it then why do we do it? Does it benefit us in any way? Not at all. In fact, it harms us. Let me put forth some of the reasons.
            <br>
            <br>
            Firstly, it clouds the mind. Have you ever listened to a song whereafter it gets stuck in your head and you have to do some deep thinking. People who have experienced this can testify that thinking deeply is extremely difficult, if not impossible, while a song is stuck in your head. Also, have you ever went to bed, and a song you were listenting to that day is preventing you from sleeping? I can't be the only one. These are just two examples of the negatives.
