	    	<h1>The problem with modern jobs</h1>
	    	<h2>And how to escape this slavery</h2>
	    	<p>
	    	I often hear people mocking others by telling them that they work "9-5" jobs which means that they work from 9 o'clock in the morning
            to 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Many people have become desensitised to this joke, and they don't put much time into thinking about
            the entailments of what this actually means. They plan on working in their current job for the rest of their lives even if it means
            that they are unhappy.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the main reasons I hate modern jobs is that there are always tasks which you have to complete on a computer. Computers are distracting
            and you often see people frequently switching between windows on a computer. It is impossible to focus like this. Furthermore, you are sitting
            in the same position the whole time, while working with a computer - this is not good for your health. There is also the risk of radiation
            being emitted from the computer.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a result of offices being built for jobs these days we spend most of our working hours indoors. Some people spend all ~8 hours of their
            work inside. This is unhealthy: You do not get sunlight. You don't get Vitamin D. It is also one of the causes of depression. Part of the
            reason why everything is done indoors is the use of computers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let me introduce to you the modern worker. He is a man who works in a tall office building with all the other people working under the
            same bosses as him. He comes to work tired, but caffinated because he couldn't sleep properly the night prior due to his neighbours 
            blasting music through their loudspeakers. He works in a company producing loudspeakers. He went through the educational system for
            fifteen years so that he could get a job which pays him just enough to rent a small apartment in a complex with many others. His job
            consists of sitting at a computer and prototyping new designs to try and make speakers louder than before. By the end of the day, he
            is exhausted.
            <br>
            <br>
            He gets home and the television is on (it is on for most hours of the day). His wife and children are consumed by it.
            His wife had prepared a sub-optimal meal which he eats while reading the news on his phone. He then goes to his bed and lays down
            before starting to watch pointless videos. This stimulation continues until he eventually falls asleep (with the videos still playing).
            He hates his life, he argues with his wife, he wishes he didn't have kids, and he would much rather prefer being dead. But the next
            day he wakes up and the cycle continues.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now I bring to you a day in the life of a traditional worker. He wakes up to the sound of the roosters in the field. He goes outside
            and the sun in shining beautifully. He then goes into his carpentry workshop adjacent to his house, and he starts his work. Occasionally,
            his children come and observe him working at his bench. The door and windows are open to allow for the clean air to flow freely in the
            room. He doesn't work under any boss so his schedule is more free.
            <br>
            <br>
            The sun is setting and he starts to smell the delicious food that his wife is preparing. All of the food is organic and has come
            from the animals and plants in his land. He completes his work for the day then heads back home to enjoy a meal with his wife and kids.
            They have a peaceful discussion about their day's work and how blessed they are to be living in their conditions. They then go to bed
            and get a good night's rest. This humble carpenter enjoys his job, he loves his wife, he views his children as a blessing and he can't
            wait to wake up the next day.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now let me ask you: which situation would you rather be in?
            <br>
            <br>
            If you say that you would prefer the former situation then I don't know what to tell you. In my opinion, the latter situation is much
            more desirable and leads to a happier life. You may say that my portrayal of a modern job is an exaggeration, but I don't think
            it is very far from reality. In fact, a lot of people are in much worse situations than the one I portrayed.
            <br>
            <br>
            So what is the solution to this? You may make the argument that all modern jobs are like the one described. This doesn't mean that there
            isn't an escape. A "YouTuber" by the name of Luke Smith makes videos talking about Linux software and independence. He went through the
            school system and chose to study linguistics. He even taught at a university for some time.
            <br>
            <br>
            He left his job and he now lives out in the countryside. I think this is a good way to escape the system: by raising enough funds to move 
            to a more rural area and to settle there. In this way, you are sort of buying your independence. You will need a lot of patience, but, 
            when you are doubting whether your choice is worth the effort, just remember that it is better than spending the rest of your life working 
            under a corporation.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is a lot more to say about this topic, and you may be wondering what the ideal living environment is. I am still trying to figure
            this out. You should try too. My advice is to travel to different places and see how the people live. See which one you are the most
            peaceful in then live there if you please. Do you think it will be a more nature-filled place or one that is industrious?
