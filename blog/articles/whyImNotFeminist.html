		<h1>Why I do not identify as a feminist</h1>
		<h2>Have I been cancelled yet?</h2>
		<p>
		When someone says the word <trees>"feminist"</trees> today, does someone seeking <trees>equality</trees> come to mind? Maybe. Maybe not.<br>
		Many people visualise a feminist as a lady who comes and screams in your face about how trash you are. Feminism has gained<br>
		a connotation of hating men. People can blabber all they want about how the original goal of feminism was to spread <trees>equality</trees><br>
		but it's reputation was destroyed by many people who associate themselves with it.<br>
		<br>
		I like to compare it to this: Imagine going out into the street and telling everyone that you are gay. Will they assume that<br>
		you mean you are happy (the original meaning)? No. They will assume that you mean you are homosexual.<br>
		<br>
		In the same way, the word <trees>"feminism"</trees> has gained a connotation that no longer allows it to mean <trees>equality</trees>. It just<br>
		seems to be about how <i>women</i> are better than <i>men</i>.<br>
		<br>
		So I am all for <trees>equality</trees>. I just don't call myself a <trees>feminist</trees> because of how the word is viewed in modern times.
